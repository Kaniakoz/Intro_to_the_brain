##### Substance Abuse 
- Drug Mechanisms 
	- most derive from plants
	- plants evolved those chemicals to attracts bugs and other animals or to repel them
		- we are animals too so it works on us
	- facilitate/ inhibit transmission at synapses
		- antagonists block
		- agonists mimic/ increase the effect
		- agonist-antagonists do both depending on what they work on
	- affinity
		- a drug has it if it binds to a certain receptor
	- efficacy
		- tendency to activate the receptor
	- most drugs work on a bunch of different receptors
		- as people vary in that department drugs hit us differently
- Predispositions 
	- genetic influences:
		- if parents drink a lot, their biological kids probably will too:
			- lower correlation for adoptive kids
		- some genes increase the alcohol abuse predisposition
			- those that affect serotonin synapses
		- magical gen wyskokowy:
			- controls the metabolism of alcohol
			- after anyone drinks ethyl alcohol:
				- enzymes in the liver metabolise it to acetaldehyde
				- the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase converts acetaldehyde to acetic acid,
					- a chemical that the body uses for energy
			- people with a gene for producing less acetaldehyde dehydrogenase metabolise acetaldehyde more slowly
				- If they drink much alcohol, they accumulate acetaldehyde, which produces flushing of the face, increased heart rate, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, impaired breathing, and tissue damage.
				- acetaldehyde is probably responsible for hangovers, although research on this topic is sparse
	- environmental influences:
		- prenatal:
			- pregnant women who drink increase the probability of a kid being an alcoholic
			- childhood environment
			- adult environment
	- behavioural predictors of abuse:
		- we study people to determine which behaviours can be symptoms of alcoholism tendencies
		- interesting findings:
			- sons of alcoholics show less than average intoxication after drinking a moderate amount of alcohol
			- those who hold liquor well are at more risk
- Synaptic Mechanisms 
	- role of dopamine:
		- released in nucleus accumbens
			- important for many types of reinforcing experiences
		- we love dopamine!
			- all good stuff releases it
		- crucial in addictive substances but not central
		![[Pasted image 20240527215509.png]]
	- cravings:
		- insistent search and need to consume a substance/ stimulus
		- cues associated with the substance trigger cravings even after a long time
		- during a period of abstinence, the nucleus accumbens synapses responding to drug cues gradually become more and more sensitive, before later declining partly
		- increases during the early stage of abstinence, and slightly declines later
		- the increased response to drug cues has been traced to facilitated glutamate synapses in the nucleus accumbens, at least for cocaine and nicotine
		- a treatment that desensitises glutamate synapses in the nucleus accumbens might reduce cravings for certain drugs
		- although certain procedures have shown promise with laboratory rodents, so far nothing has been successfully applied to humans 
	- tolerance & withdrawal:
		- tolerance -> enjoyable effect decreases for a certain dose
		- tolerance increases with time
			- it is learned
		- cues associated with receiving the drug activate learned mechanisms that counteract the effects of the drug
		- tolerance can be weakened by extinction procedures
		- withdrawal -> strong reaction to absence of a drug
		- symptoms of withdrawal:
			- sweating
			- anxiety
			- vomiting
			- diarrhoea
			- irritability
			- fatigue
			- shaking
			- hallucinations
			- fever
			- cardiovascular problems
		- getting a drug while withdrawal gives a powerful effects
- Treatments:
	- AA, NA, etc.
	- therapy
		- e.g. contingency management -> rewards for staying sober/ clean
	- medication for:
		- alcohol abuse:
			- disulfram (antabuse):
				- antagonises the enzyme metabolising acetaldehyde
					- you get nauseous after drinking
				- about equal to placebo
					- because thinking sth is that medication also stops you from drinking
				- people more often quit taking the meds than quit drinking
				- another method -> meds straight after drinking:
					- works but is unpopular
			- naloxone (revia) & naltrexone:
				- block opiate receptors
				- decrease pleasure from alcohol
			- acamprosate:
				- similar effect to naltrexone
				- mechanism of effect still uncertain
			- opiate abuse:
				- heroin was made to combat morphine abuse
					- well, didn't work like expected
				- substances that satisfy craving in a safer way but don't end the addiction:
					- switching to methadone to avoid the rush
					- buprenophine & levomethadyl acetate (LAAM):
						- similar to methadone
						- LAAM produces a long-lasting effect
- Summary:
	- drugs increasing activity at a synapse-> agonists; ones that decrease activity -> antagonists
	- drugs act in many ways, varying in their affinity & efficacy
	- predispositions to alcohol or drug abuse arise from genetics, prenatal environment, and later environment. 
	- early onset alcoholism reflects a stronger genetic predisposition than does later-onset alcoholism
	- people who drink alcohol with relatively little sign of intoxication are more likely than other people to develop alcohol abuse
	- reinforcing brain stimulation, reinforcing experiences, and stimulant drugs increase the activity of axons that release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens
	- for abused drugs other than stimulants:
		- the amount of dopamine release does not correlate well with pleasure or addiction
		- blocking dopamine synapses has little effect on opiate use
	- evidently dopamine is not as essential to addiction as researchers previously believed
	- repeated use of cocaine:
		- decreases the response of the nucleus accumbens to all pleasant experiences
		- increases attention to cues reminding the individual of cocaine
	- during abstinence from cocaine:
		- glutamate synapses in the nucleus accumbens become more responsive to cocaine-related cues
		- that increased sensitivity increases cue-induced cravings for cocaine
	- repeated use of a drug leads to tolerance & withdrawal 
	- several drugs including antabuse and methadone help some people decrease their use of alcohol or opiates
##### Mood Disorders 
- Major Depressive Disorder 
	- symptoms
		- feeling sad & helpless for most of the time for a very long period of time
		- no joy
		- cognitive problems
		- low motivation
		- sleep problems
		- contemplating suicide
		- absence of happiness
		- lowered empathy
	- prevalence:
		- same for men & women out of reproductive age
		- more common for women in the reproductive age
	- episodes are more common than long-term depression
		- early episodes tend to be longer
		- later are shorter but more frequent
	- genetics:
		- moderate degree of heritability
		- also:
			- injuries
			- poor diet
			- stress
			- other causes
		- we do not have a sure gene that causes depression
			- demographic and ethnic differences
			- symptoms vary between people
			- we may be combining separate syndromes
			- effect of a gene varies with the environment
		- we suspect serotonin transporters
	- abnormalities of hemispheric dominance
		- increased activity in the right prefrontal cortex
			- rather a predisposition to depression, not its effect
- Antidepressant Drugs 
	-  types:
		![[Pasted image 20240528113616.png]]
		![[Pasted image 20240528111705.png]]
		- trycyclics:
			- imipramine
			- blocking the transporter proteins that reabsorb serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine into the presynaptic neuron after their release
			- prolonging the presence of the neurotransmitters in the presynaptic cleft
			- block:
				- histamine receptors -> drowsiness
				- acetylcholine receptors -> dry mouth, urination problems
				- certain Na channels -> heart irregularities
		- SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors):
			- attach to the centre of the serotonin transporter protein and lock it into a shape that prevents serotonin from binding to it
			- milder side effects than the tricyclics but similar effectiveness
			- common SSRIs:
				- fluoxetine
				- sertraline
				- fluvoxamine
				- citalopram
				- paroxetine
		- SNRIs:
			- serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
			- duloxetine
			- venlafaxine
			- block reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine
			- improve certain aspects of memory
		- monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
			- phenelzine
			- block monoamine oxidase
				- metabolises catecholamines and serotonin into inactive forms
			- when MAOIs block this enzyme, the presynaptic terminal has more of its transmitter available for release
			- no longer first choice for treatment
			- you have to avoid certain foods 
		- atypical
			- bupropion
			- ketamine
		- many side effects
	- how effective are they:
		- neurotrophins:
			- aid in survival & development of neurons
			- depressed folks have less of one of them (BDNF)
				- synaptic plasticity
				- learning
				- proliferation of new neurons in the hippocampus
				- drugs may increase amount of BDNF
		- at least more effective than placebos
		- placebos work strongly here
		- little effect on suicide rate
		- it's difficult to find a good drug for a certain person, lots of trial & error
	- alternatives:
		- cognitive behavioural therapy
		- electroconvulsive therapy
			- works 
			- sometimes causes memory impairments
		- exercise & diet
		- repairing sleep schedule
		- people with seasonal affective depression can be treated with a ton of bright light
			- it's now tested for standard depression
		- deep brain stimulation:
			- physician implants a battery-powered device into the brain to deliver periodic stimulation to certain brain areas
				- areas are chosen because of studies showing that they increase their activity as a result of antidepressant drugs
			- still in the experimental stage, but results have been encouraging
			- most patients who failed to respond to all other treatments show gradual improvement over months, and about half get fully back to normal, as long as the stimulation continues
			- a possible refinement of this procedure is to use optogenetic stimulation
				- can control individual connections, rather than all the axons going from one area to another 
- Bipolar Disorder 
	- depression + mania
	- symptoms of mania:
		- restless activity
		- excessive self-confidence
		- rambling speech
		- loss of inhibition
	- usually starts in the teenage years/ early 20s
	- men are more likely to get type 1 bipolar
	- women are more likely to get treatment
	- linked to many genes but none are specific to bipolar
	- treatments:
		- lithium salts
			- works on the hippocampus
		- anti-convulsants
		- antidepressants
		- anti-psychotics
		- diet
		- sleep
		- omega3
- Summary
	- people with major depression find that almost nothing makes them happy
	- In most cases, depression occurs as a series of episodes
	-  depression has a genetic predisposition, but no one gene has a strong effect by itself
		- stress can provoke depression by activating the immune system
	- depression is associated with decreased activity in the left hemisphere of the cortex
	- several kinds of antidepressant drugs are in wide use:
		- tricyclics -> block reuptake of serotonin & catecholamines
		- SSRIs block reuptake of serotonin
		- SNRIs block reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine
		- MAOIs block an enzyme that breaks down catecholamines and serotonin. 
	- antidepressants probably do not produce their benefits simply by increasing synaptic levels of serotonin or any other transmitter
		- ordinarily they affect synapses quickly but the mood benefits develop over weeks. 
	- one hypothesis is that antidepressants exert their effects by promoting development of new neurons in the hippocampus, new neurons facilitate new learning that competes with old, unpleasant thoughts. 
	- most people do not respond quickly to antidepressant drugs, and part of the apparent benefit may be due to a placebo effect or the passage of time
	- psychotherapy is about as effective as antidepressants. 
	- psychotherapy is more likely than antidepressant drugs to produce long-lasting benefits
	- other therapies for depression include exercise, electro-convulsive therapy, altered sleep patterns, and deep brain stimulation
	- exposure to bright lights is an effective, inexpensive treatment not only for seasonal affective disorder, but also for other major depression
	- people with bipolar disorder alternate between depression and mania. 
	- effective therapies for bpd include:
		- lithium salts 
		- certain anti-convulsant drugs
		- consistent sleep schedule 
###### Schizophrenia
- Diagnosis
	- symptoms:
		- split between the emotional & intellectual aspects of experience
		- deterioration in everyday functioning
		- delusions
		- hallucinations
		- disorganised speech
		- grossly disorganised behaviour
		- weak emotional expression, speech & socialisation
		- cognitive symptoms
			- impairments of thoughts and reasoning 
			- difficulty with understanding abstract concepts
			- trouble maintaining and focusing attention
			- memory impairments
	- limitation of working memory could explain some aspects of schizophrenia
	- difficult to diagnose
	- positive symptoms -> behaviours that are present that should be absent
	- negative symptoms -> behaviours that are absent that should be present
		- stable over time
		- difficult to treat
	- differential diagnosis:
		- ruling out any other conditions, such as:
			- substance abuse
			- brain damage
			- undetected hearing deficits
			- Huntington's disease:
				- hallucinations
				- delusions
				- disordered thinking
				- motor symptoms
				- genetic disease
			- nutritional problems
	- demographic data
		- 0.5 - 1% of populations
		- everywhere in the world
		- more common in cities
			- unstable social relationships
			- poverty
			- air pollution
			- exposure to toxic substances
			- less vitamin D
		- lifetime prevalence more common for men
		- more severe in men
	- interesting facts about schizophrenics:
		- are more likely to have autoimmune diseases
		- increased risk of colon cancer
		- decreased risk of:
			- several other types of cancer
			- arthritis
			- allergies
		- women who have a schizophrenic breakdown during pregnancy usually give birth to daughters
		- women who have a breakdown shortly after giving birth usually gave birth to sons
		- characteristic body odour, attributed to the chemical trans-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid
			- have decreased ability to smell that chemical
		- deficits in pursuit eye movements— the ability to keep their eyes on a moving target
- Genetics
	- family studies
		- concordance -> agreement
			- higher for monozygotic twins (50%) than for dizygotic ones in terms of probability of schizophrenia
		![[Pasted image 20240528094253.png]]
	- adopted children who develop schizophrenia:
		- more common in their biological parents than in adoptive ones
		- can either help the hypothesis of genetics or prenatal environment
		- highest chance when biological mother had schizophrenia & adoptive family was severely disordered
- The Neurodevelopmental Hypothesis:
	- pre/neonatal influences produce abnormalities in developing brains that leave the brain vulnerable to other disturbances later in life
	- proof
		- several kinds of prenatal/early difficulties are linked to later schizophrenia
		- schizophrenics have minor brain abnormalities that apparently originate early in life
		- it is plausible that abnormalities of early development could impair behaviour in adulthood
	- prenatal & neonatal environment:
		- intermediate risk factors:
			- crowded cities
			- toxoplasmosis
		- low risk factors:
			- poor nutrition or extreme stress of the mother during pregnancy
			- premature birth
			- low birth weight
			- complication during delivery
			- head injuries in early childhood
			- Rh+ kids & Rh- mother (konflikt serologiczny)
			- season-of-birth defect:
				- more common for those born in winter
				- more common further from equator
				- what causes it:
					- viral infections, e.g. influenza
					- mothers got sick in autumn
	- mild brain abnormalities:
		- some have less than average amount of grey matter
		- white matter is reduced
		- minor abnormalities in subcortical areas
		- less-than-average blood flow to the brain
		- 5% smaller brain volume than average
		- brain areas with consistent signs of abnormality include some that mature slowly, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
			- weaker than average connections from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to other brain areas
			- less than normal activity in this area during tasks requiring attention and memory
		- deficits in memory
	- long-term course:
		- we used to think it is progressive -> gets worse over time
		- now we know that is is not usually the case
		- some deteriorate, some recover, some get remission
		- even when further deterioration does occur, it could be a result of drug use (common in people with schizophrenia) rather than a result of schizophrenia itself
	- early development and later psychopathology
		- showing problems since childhood
		- minor problems as a kid -> bigger as an adult
		- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex takes time to mature
			- this area show consistent signs of deficits in schizophrenics
- Treatments
	- antipsychotic (neuroleptic) drugs & dopamine:
		- chlorpromazine relieves positive symptoms but not for everyone
		- 2 chemical families:
			- phenothiazines
			- butyrophenones
				- haloperidol
		- blocking dopamine synapses (especially D$_2$ type)
			- better blockers are more effective for treatment
		- dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia:
			- results from excessive activity at dopamine areas
		- problems:
			- dopamine synapses blockers produce their benefits by acting on neurons in the mesolimbocortical system:
				- neurons that project from the midbrain to the limbic system and prefrontal cortex
			-  these drugs also block dopamine neurons in the mesostriatal system that projects to the basal ganglia
			- the effect on the basal ganglia produces tardive dyskinesia:
				- tremors
				- other involuntary movements that develop gradually and to varying degrees
	- 2$^n$$^d$ generation antipsychotic drugs:
		- reduce the risk of movement problems compared to 1$^s$$^t$ gen
		- most common ones:
			- cloapine
			- amisulpride
			- risperidone
			- olanzapine
			- aripiprazole
		- less effect on dopamine receptors
		- antagonise type 5-HT$_2$ more strongly
		- increase the release of glutamate
		- side effects;
			- weight gain
			- impairment of the immune system
		- scientists are sure which gen improves the quality of life more
		- similar effectiveness
		![[Pasted image 20240528101205.png]]
	- role of glutamate
		- glutamate hypothesis:
			- deficient activity at glutamate synapses in the prefrontal cortex
			- increased dopamine can produce similar effects to decreased glutamate
		- further evidence comes from phencyclidine (PCP )/ angel dust:
			- inhibits NMDA glutamate receptors
			- bigger dose produces positive & negative symptoms of schizophrenia
			- PCP & ketamine produce little if any psychotic response in pre-adolescents, similar to schizophrenia
			- LSD, amphetamine, and cocaine produce temporary schizophrenic symptoms in almost anyone, and the effects are not much worse in people with a history of schizophrenia than in anyone else
			- PCP produces a relapse for someone who has recovered from schizophrenia.
		- we can't just inject glutamate to check our hypothesis:
			- could cause over-stimulation, confusion or damage
			- possible alternative:
				- glutamate receptors have a second site that glycine activates to enhance the response to glutamate
				- a possible approach would be to try to activate the glycine receptor
		- so far all attempts to treat schizophrenia with drugs aimed at glutamate or glycine have produced only disappointing results
- Summary
	- positive symptoms of schizophrenia -> behaviours that are not present in most other people:
		- hallucinations
		- delusions
		- inappropriate emotions
		- bizarre behaviours
		- thought disorder
	- negative symptoms -> normal behaviours absent that should be present:
		- deficits of:
			- social interaction
			- emotional expression
			- speech
	- before diagnosing someone with schizophrenia, a therapist needs to rule out:
		- brain damage
		- drug abuse
		- other conditions that could produce similar symptoms
	- studies of twins and adopted children imply a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia
		- however, the adoption studies do not distinguish between the roles of genetics and prenatal environment
	- researchers have identified many genes associated with schizophrenia, but no common gene increases the risk by much
		- promising hypothesis -> schizophrenia results from new mutations/ micro-deletions of any of the hundreds of genes that are important for brain development. 
	- according to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis:
		- either genes or difficulties early in life, often before birth, impair brain development in ways that increase vulnerability to later insults and predispose to behavioural abnormalities beginning in early adulthood
	- many people with schizophrenia show mild abnormalities of brain development, especially in the temporal and frontal lobes
		- they also show cognitive deficits that make sense if their frontal and temporal lobes are less than fully functional
	- most people with schizophrenia do not continue deteriorating throughout life
		- some recover
		- some remain troubled throughout life
		- some alternate between remission and relapse
		- although the brain shows abnormalities during the first episode of schizophrenia, most people show little or no increase in those abnormalities as time passes
	- parts of the prefrontal cortex are very slow to mature & it is plausible that early disruption of those areas might produce behavioural symptoms that manifest as schizophrenia in young adults
	- according to the dopamine hypothesis:
		- schizophrenia is due to excess dopamine activity
		- drugs that block dopamine synapses reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
		- drugs that increase dopamine activity induce the positive symptoms. 
	- prolonged use of antipsychotic drugs may produce tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder.
		- Second generation antipsychotic drugs reduce the risk of it
	- according to the glutamate hypothesis
		- part of the problem is deficient glutamate activity
	- Phencyclidine:
		- blocks NMDA glutamate synapses
		- produces both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia
			- especially in people predisposed to schizophrenia. 
##### Autism Spectrum Disorders
- symptoms &  characteristics:
	- combines autism & Asperger's
		- we don't use the latter anymore
	- more common in boys but more severe in girls
		- maybe because the diagnosis is shit
	- common symptoms:
		- Deficits in social and emotional exchange 
		- Deficits in gestures, facial expressions, and other nonverbal communication
		- Stereotyped behaviours, such as repetitive movements 
		- Resistance to a change in routine
		- Unusually weak or strong responses to stimuli, such as indifference to pain or a panicked reaction to a sound
	- additional symptoms:
		- epilepsy
		- anxiety
		- poor coordination
		- deficits in:
			- attention
			- sleep
		- avoiding eye contact
			- social cues don't attract their attention
	- develop narrow skills and excel at them
	- better at detecting visual motion
- genetics & other causes:
	- there are genes linked to it but no common one with a large effect
	- we can figure out if the genetic mutation comes from a mother/father
	- prenatal environment has an impact
	- consuming folic acid decreases a chance of birthing a child with autism
	- big head in little children
- treatments:
	- risperidone sometimes decreases symptoms but there are consequences
	- behavioural treatments for the stereotyped behaviours
	- cognitive behavioural therapy
- summary:
	- autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed more often now than in the past.
	- the severity of symptoms varies greatly. 
	- primary symptoms include a deficiency of social behaviour and communication, including nonverbal communication.
	- many individuals also have repetitive stereotyped behaviours. 
	- no one gene is responsible for this condition. 
	- In some cases, it relates to new mutations or micro-deletions, including one mutation to a mitochondrial gene.
	- difficulties in the prenatal environment also contribute. 
		- some cases result because the mother during pregnancy produced certain antibodies that attack brain proteins.
	- consuming folic acid decreases the probability of having an autistic child.
	- behavioural treatments are the only effective approach to treating social and communicative deficits.
	- many parents try fad treatments of doubtful effectiveness.

###### ==Structure of the vertebrate nervous system==
- terminology to describe the nervous system:
	- Central Nervous System
		- brain + spinal cord
	- Peripheral nervous system
		- connects brain & spinal cord to the rest of the body
		- somatic
			- controls voluntary muscles
			- conveys sensory information to CNS
		- autonomic:
			- controls involuntary muscles
			- sympathetic
				- expends energy
			- parasympathetic
				- conserves energy
	- directions in brain
	![[Pasted image 20240429112630.png]]
	-  terms:
		- Dorsal
			- toward the back, away from the ventral (stomach) side. The top of the human brain is considered dorsal because it has that position in four-legged animals.
		- Ventral 
			- toward the stomach, away from the dorsal (back) side
		- Anterior 
			- toward the front end
		- Posterior
			- toward the rear end
		- Superior 
			- above another part
		- Inferior 
			- below another part
		- Lateral 
			- toward the side, away from the midline
		- Medial 
			- toward the midline, away from the side
		- Proximal
			- located close (approximate) to the point of origin or attachment
		- Distal 
			- located more distant from the point of origin or attachment
		- Ipsilateral 
			- on the same side of the body (e.g., two parts on the left or two on the right)
		- Contralateral 
			- on the opposite side of the body (one on the left and one on the right)
		- Coronal plane (or frontal plane)
			- a plane that shows brain structures as seen from the front
		- Sagittal plane 
			- a plane that shows brain structures as seen from the side
		- Horizontal plane (or transverse plane)
			- a plane that shows brain structures as seen from above
- parts of the nervous system:
	- Lamina 
		- a row or layer of cell bodies separated from other cell bodies by a layer of axons and dendrites
	- Column 
		- a set of cells perpendicular to the surface of the cortex, with similar properties
	- Tract
		- a set of axons within the CNS, also known as a projection. If axons extend from cell bodies in structure A to synapses onto B, we say that the fibers “project” from A onto B.
	- Nerve 
		- a set of axons in the periphery, either from the CNS to a muscle or gland or from a sensory organ to the CNS
	- Nucleus 
		- a cluster of neuron cell bodies within the CNS
	- Ganglion 
		- a cluster of neuron cell bodies, usually outside the CNS (as in the sympathetic nervous system)
	- Gyrus (pl.: gyri) 
		- a protuberance on the surface of the brain 
	- Sulcus (pl.: sulci) 
		- a fold or groove that separates one gyrus from another
	- Fissure 
		- a long, deep sulcus
- the spinal cord
	![[Pasted image 20240429154950.png]]
	- the part of the CNS within the spinal column.
	- communicates with all the sense organs & muscles except those of the head
	- segmented structure:
		- each segment has a sensory nerve and a motor nerve on both the left & right side
	- the entering dorsal roots (axon bundles) carry sensory information, 
	- the exiting ventral roots carry motor information. 
	- the cell bodies of the sensory neurons are in clusters of neurons outside the spinal cord -> dorsal root ganglia
	- neuron clusters:
		- outside the CNS -> a ganglion
		- inside the CNS -> a nucleus.) 
	- cell bodies of the motor neurons are inside the spinal cord
	- neurons from the grey matter of the spinal cord send axons to the brain/to other parts of the spinal cord through the white matter, containing myelinated axons
	- each segment of the spinal cord sends sensory information to the brain and receives motor commands from the brain
		- all that information passes through tracts of axons in the spinal cord
		- if the spinal cord is cut at a given segment, the brain loses sensation & motor control from that segment and below. 
- the autonomic nervous system
	![[Pasted image 20240429155029.png]]
	- neurons that receive information from and send commands to organs 
	- sympathetic nervous system:
		- a network of nerves that prepare the organs for a burst of vigorous activity
		- consists of chains of ganglia just to the left and right of the spinal cord’s central regions 
			- the thoracic and lumbar areas)
		- sympathetic axons prepare the organs for “fight or flight,”
			- increasing breathing and heart rate 
			- decreasing digestive activity.
		- sympathetic ganglia are closely linked, so they often act as a single system “in sympathy” with one another, although certain events activate some parts more than others
		- sweat glands, the adrenal glands, the muscles that constrict blood vessels, and the muscles that erect the hairs of the skin have sympathetic input but no parasympathetic input
	- parasympathetic nervous system
		- “rest and digest” system
		- facilitates vegetative, non-emergency responses.
		- opposite actions to sympathetic stuff + promotes sexual arousal
		- also known as the craniosacral system because it consists of the cranial nerves and nerves from the sacral spinal cord
		- long preganglionic axons extend from the spinal cord to parasympathetic ganglia close to each internal organ
		- shorter postganglionic fibres extend from the parasympathetic ganglia into the organs themselves
		- because the parasympathetic ganglia are not linked to one another, they act more independently than the sympathetic ones
		- release acetylcholine onto the organs. 
	- Because the two systems use different transmitters, certain drugs excite or inhibit one system or the other. 
	- sympathetic and parasympathetic systems produce contrary effects, but both are constantly active to varying degrees, and many stimuli arouse parts of both systems 
- the hindbrain
	![[Pasted image 20240429155110.png]]
	 ![[Pasted image 20240429155128.png]]
	- the posterior part of the brain
	- consists of:
		- medulla (medulla oblongata):
			- enlarged extension of the spinal cord
			- the head & the organs connect to the medulla & adjacent areas by 12 pairs of cranial nerves (one of each pair on the right & one on the left)
			- cranial nerves originating there control vital reflexes:
				- breathing
				- heart rate
				- vomiting
				- salivation
				- coughing
				- sneezing
				- etc
				- types of cranial nerves:
					- I. Olfactory
						- Smell
					- II. Optic 
						- Vision
					- III. Oculomotor 
						- Control of eye movements; pupil constriction
					- IV. Trochlear 
						- Control of eye movements
					- V. Trigeminal 
						- Skin sensations from most of the face
						- control of jaw muscles for chewing&swallowing
					- VI. Abducens
						- Control of eye movements
					- VII. Facial 
						- Taste from the anterior two thirds of the tongue
						- control of facial expressions, crying, salivation, and dilation of the head’s blood vessels
					- VIII. Statoacoustic 
						- Hearing
						- equilibrium
					- IX. Glossopharyngeal 
						- Taste and other sensations from throat and posterior third of the tongue
						- control of swallowing, salivation, throat movements during speech
					- X. Vagus 
						- Sensations from neck and thorax
						- control of throat, oesophagus & larynx
						- parasympathetic nerves to stomach, intestines, and other organs
					- XI. Accessory 
						- Control of neck and shoulder movements 
					- XII. Hypoglossal 
						- Control of muscles of the tongue
			- many opiate receptors there (dangerous!)
		- pons:
			- anterior and ventral to the medulla
			- contains nuclei for several cranial nerves
			- axons from each half of the brain cross to the opposite side of the spinal cord -> enabling contralateral control 
		- cerebellum:
			- large hindbrain structure with many deep folds
			- control of movement
			- critical for some types of learning & conditioning
			- balance + coordination **& beyond**
		- damage to the cerebellum:
			- trouble shifting attention back and forth between auditory and visual stimuli
			- difficulty with timing, such as judging whether one rhythm is faster than another
	- the brainstem:
		- medulla 
		- pons
		- midbrain
		- certain central structures of the forebrain
- the midbrain
	 ![[Pasted image 20240429155149.png]]
	- early in development it is in the middle of the brain, although in adult mammals it is dwarfed and surrounded by the forebrain.
	- more prominent in reptiles, amphibians, and fish
	- tectum -> roof of the midbrain
	- superior & inferior colliculus -> the swellings on each side of the tectum
		- important for sensory processing
			- inferior -> hearing 
			- superior -> vision
		- tegmentum
			- under the tectum
			- the intermediate level of the midbrain.
		- substantia nigra
			- gives rise to a dopamine-containing pathways that facilitate readiness for the movement.
- the forebrain
	 ![[Pasted image 20240429155212.png]]
	 ![[Pasted image 20240429155237.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240429155259.png]]
	- the most prominent part of the mammalian brain
	- consists of two cerebral hemispheres (one on the left and one on the right):
		- each hemisphere is organised to receive sensory information, mostly from the contralateral side of the body
		- controls muscles, mostly on the contralateral side
	- cerebral cortex -> the outer portion is the cerebral cortex:
		- under the cerebral cortex are other structures:
			- thalamus
			- basal ganglia
	- limbic system:
		- forms a border around the brainstem
		- includes the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate gyrus of the cerebral cortex
		- amygdala:
			- part of the circuit that is most central for evaluating emotional information, especially with regard to fear
	- thalamus:
		- together with hypothalamus form the diencephalon:
			- a section distinct from the telencephalon:
				- the rest of the forebrain.
		- a pair of structures (left & right) in the centre of the forebrain
		- most sensory information goes first to the thalamus, which processes it and sends output to the cerebral cortex
			- exception -> olfactory information:
				- goes from the olfactory receptors to the olfactory bulbs & then directly to the cerebral cortex
		- many nuclei of the thalamus receive their input from a sensory system, such as vision, & transmit information to a single area of the cerebral cortex
			- cerebral cortex sends information back to the thalamus, prolonging and magnifying certain kinds of input & focusing attention on particular stimuli.
	- hypothalamus & pituitary gland:
		- hypothalamus:
			- small area near the base of the brain just ventral to the thalamus
			- has widespread connections with the rest of the brain
			- contains distinct nuclei
			- conveys messages to the pituitary gland, altering its release of hormones. 
			- damage to any hypothalamic nucleus:
				- abnormalities in motivated behaviours:
					- feeding
					- drinking
					- temperature regulation
					- sexual behaviour
					- fighting
					- activity level
		- pituitary gland:
			- endocrine gland attached to the base of the hypothalamus
			- in response to messages from the hypothalamus, synthesises hormones that the blood carries to organs through out the body.
	- basal ganglia:
		- a group of subcortical structures lateral to the thalamus
		- include three major structures: 
			- caudate nucleus
			- putamen
			- globus pallidus
			- some authorities include other structures as well
		- damage to the basal ganglia impairs movement in e.g. Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases
		- integrate motivational & emotional behaviour to increase the vigour of selected actions
		- critical for learned skills, habits & other types of learning that develop gradually with extended experience 
	- basal forebrain (nucleus basalis):
		- one of the structures on the ventral surface of the forebrain
		- receives input from the hypothalamus and basal ganglia 
		- sends axons that release acetylcholine to widespread areas in the cerebral cortex
		- key part of the brain’s system for arousal, wakefulness, & attention
		- its inactivity/deterioration causes impairments of attention & intellect for patients with Parkinson’s & Alzheimer’s diseases
	- hippocampus:
		- large structure between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, mostly toward the posterior of the forebrain
		- critical for certain types of memories, especially memories for individual events
		- essential for monitoring where you are & where you are going
- the ventricles
	![[Pasted image 20240429155355.png]]
	- four fluid-filled cavities within the brain
		- each hemisphere contains one of the two large lateral ventricles
		- toward their posterior, they connect to the third ventricle, positioned at the mid-line, separating the left thalamus from the right
		- the third ventricle connects to the fourth ventricle in the centre of the medulla. 
	- cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):
		- produced by the choroid plexus along the walls of the four ventricles 
		- clear fluid similar to blood plasma
		- fills the ventricles, flowing from the lateral ones to the third & fourth
			- from the fourth ventricle, some of it flows into the central canal of the spinal cord
			- but more goes into the narrow spaces between the brain and the thin meninges
				- membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.
				- have pain receptors
				- meningitis (inflammation of the meninges) is painful
				- swollen blood vessels in the meninges are responsible for the pain of a migraine headache
		- cushions the brain against mechanical shock when the head moves
		- provides buoyancy -> supports the weight of the brain
		- provides a reservoir of hormones & nutrition for the brain & spinal cord
		- obstructed CSF flow:
			- CSF accumulates within the ventricles or in the subarachnoid space, increasing pressure on the brain
			- for infants the skull bones spread, causing hydrocephalus
				- an overgrown head.
- summary
	- The vertebrate nervous system has two main divisions:
		- central nervous system
		- peripheral nervous system
	- Each segment of the spinal cord has a sensory nerve and a motor nerve on both the left and right sides. 
	- Spinal pathways convey information to the brain.
	- The sympathetic nervous system activates the body’s internal organs for vigorous activities. 
	- The parasympathetic system promotes digestion and other nonemergency processes. 
	- The central nervous system consists of the spinal cord, the hindbrain, the midbrain, and the forebrain. 
	- The hindbrain consists of the medulla, pons, and cerebellum:
		- The medulla and pons control breathing, heart rate, and other vital functions through the cranial nerves. 
		- The cerebellum contributes to movement, timing short intervals, and certain types of learning and conditioning. 
	- The cerebral cortex receives its sensory information, except for olfaction, from the thalamus. 
	- The subcortical areas of the forebrain include the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, basal ganglia, and hippocampus. 
	- The cerebral ventricles contain fluid that provides buoyancy and cushioning for the brain. 
###### ==The cerebral cortex==
- in general:
	- most prominent part of the mammalian brain
	- grey matter on the outer surface
	- white matter -> axons from grey extending inward
	- neurons in each hemisphere communicate with neurons in the corresponding part of the other hemisphere through corpus callosum & the smaller anterior commissure 
		- several other commissures link subcortical structures
	- brains differ between different mammals
- organisation of the cerebral cortex
	![[Pasted image 20240430110000.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240430110016.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240430110035.png]]
	- we focus on relationship between structure & function
		- cause there are too many differences on microscopic level
	- contains up to 6 different laminae:
		- layers of cell bodies that are parallel to the surface of the cortex and separated from each other by layers of fibres
		- vary in thickness and prominence from one part of the cortex to another
		- a given lamina may be absent from certain areas
		- Lamina V:
			- sends long axons to the spinal cord and other distant areas
			- thickest in the motor cortex, which has the greatest control of the muscles.
		- Lamina IV
			- receives axons from the sensory nuclei of the thalamus
			- prominent in the sensory areas of the cortex (visual, auditory, and somatosensory)
			- absent from the motor cortex
	- cells of the cortex are also organised into columns of cells perpendicular to the laminae
		- the cells within a given column have similar properties to one another
		- if one cell in a column responds to touch on the palm of the left hand, then the other cells in that column do, too
		- if one cell responds to a horizontal pattern of light at a particular location, then other cells in the column respond to the same pattern in nearby locations.
- the occipital lobe:
	- at the posterior (caudal) end of cortex
	- main target for visual information
	- primary visual cortex/striate cortex:
		- the posterior pole of the occipital lobe
		- striped appearance in cross section
		- destruction of any part of the striate cortex causes cortical blindness in the related part of the visual field
			- extensive damage to the striate cortex of the right hemisphere causes blindness in the left visual field (from viewer's perspective)
			- a person with cortical blindness has:
				- normal eyes & pupillary reflexes
				- no conscious visual perception
				- no visual imagery (not even in dreams). 
		- eyes provide the stimulus, but the visual cortex provides the experience
- the parietal lobe:
	- between the occipital lobe and the central sulcus (a deep groove in the surface of the cortex)
	- postcentral gyrus/primary somatosensory cortex:
		- just posterior to the central sulcus
		- receives sensations from:
			- touch receptors
			- muscle-stretch receptors
			- joint receptors
		- includes four bands of cells parallel to the central sulcus
			- separate areas along each band receive simultaneous information from different parts of the body
			- two of the bands receive mostly light-touch information:
			- one receives deep-pressure information
			- one receives a combination of both 
			- the postcentral gyrus represents the body four times
	- monitors all the information about eye, head, and body positions and passes it on to brain areas that control movement
	- essential not only for spatial but also numerical information
- the temporal lobe
	- the lateral portion of each hemisphere, near the temples
	- the primary cortical target for auditory information
	- the human temporal lobe (usually the left one) is essential for understanding spoken language
	- also contributes to complex aspects of vision
		- perception of movement
		- recognition of faces
	- when psychiatric patients report hallucinations, brain scans detect much activity in the temporal lobes
	- important for emotional and motivational behaviors
	- results of damage:
		- set of behaviors known as the Klüver-Bucy syndrome
			- previously wild and aggressive monkeys fail to display normal fears and anxieties 
			- they put almost anything they find into their mouths and attempt to pick up snakes and lighted matches
			- we don't really know why:
				- maybe it is no longer afraid (an emotional change)	
				- maybe it no longer recognises what a snake is (a cognitive change)
- the frontal lobe
	- contains the primary motor cortex & the prefrontal cortex
	- extends from the central sulcus to the anterior limit of the brain
	- precentral gyrus:
		- the posterior portion of the frontal lobe
		- specialised for the control of fine movements, such as moving a finger
		- separate areas responsible for different parts of the body, mostly on the contralateral (opposite) side but also with slight control of the ipsilateral (same) side
		- no area in the motor cortex controls just a single muscle
			- if two muscles usually move together, then the brain areas that control one of them largely overlap those that control the other one 
	- prefrontal cortex:
		- most anterior portion of the frontal lobe
		- species with a larger cerebral cortex devote a larger percentage of it to the prefrontal cortex
		- neurons there:
			- have huge numbers of synapses
			- integrate an enormous amount of information.
		- functions:
			- has 3 major regions:
				- posterior:
					- movement
				- middle:
					- working memory
					- cognitive control
					- emotional reactions
				- anterior:
					- making decisions
					- evaluating which of several courses of action is likely to achieve the best outcome
					-  people with prefrontal cortical damage often make decisions that seem impulsive, because they failed to weigh all the likely pros and cons.
- lobotomies:
	- absolute shitshow
	- surgical disconnection of the prefrontal cortex from the rest of the brain
	- of damaging the prefrontal cortex/cutting its connections to the rest of the cortex
	- common consequences:
		- apathy
		- loss of the ability to plan & take initiative
		- memory disorders
		- distractibility
		- a loss of emotional expressions
		- people lost their social inhibitions:
			- ignoring the rules of polite, civilised conduct
			- acted impulsively because they failed to calculate adequately the probable outcomes of their behaviours.
- how do the parts work together
	- binding problem/large-scale integration system:
		- how do various brain areas produce a perception of a single object?
		- relatively few cells combine one sense with another
			- even when they do, they don’t fully answer the question of how we bind sensory information together
		- although researchers cannot fully explain binding, they know what is necessary for it to occur: 
			- if you perceive two sensations as happening at the same time and in approximately the same place
- summary:
	- brain size varies among mammals but the overall organisation is similar
	- the cerebral cortex has six laminae of neurons
	- a given lamina may be absent from certain parts of the cortex
	- the cortex is organised into columns of cells arranged perpendicular to the laminae
	- the occipital lobe is primarily responsible for vision
		- damage to its part leads to blindness in part of the visual field
	- the parietal lobe processes body sensations
	- the postcentral gyrus contains four representations of the body
	- the temporal lobe contributes to:
		- hearing
		- complex aspects of vision
		- processing of emotional information
	- the frontal lobe includes the prefrontal cortex & precentral gyrus, which controls fine movements
	- the prefrontal cortex is important for:
		- planning actions
		- working memory
		- certain aspects of emotion
		- decision making
	- the binding problem is the question of how we connect activities in different brain areas, such as sights and sounds
	- binding requires perceiving that two aspects of a stimulus ocurred at the same place at the same time
###### ==Research methods==
- general methods:
	- examine the effects of brain damage:
		- after damage/temporary inactivation, what aspects of behaviour are impaired?
	- examine the effects of stimulating a brain area:
		- ideally, if damaging some area impairs a behaviour, stimulating that area should enhance the behaviour
	- record brain activity during behaviour
	- correlate brain anatomy with behaviour:
		- do people with some unusual behaviour also have unusual brains?
		- if so, in what way?
- effects of brain damage:
	- different region, different consequences 
	- difficult to research -> researchers often turn to producing carefully localised damage in laboratory animals:
		- ablation -> removal of a brain area, generally with a surgical knife
		- researchers sometimes make a lesion (damage), by means of a stereotaxic instrument:
			- a device for the precise placement of electrodes in the brain
		- by consulting a stereotaxic atlas (map) of a species’ brain, a researcher aims an electrode at the desired position relative to landmarks on the skull
		- the researcher anaesthetises an animal, drills a small hole in the skull, inserts the electrode, lowers it to the target, and passes an electrical current just sufficient to damage that area
		- after the death of the animal, someone takes slices of its brain, applies stains, and verifies the actual location of the damage
		- production of a sham lesion to prove the deficit wasn’t caused by anaesthetising the animal, drilling a hole in its skull, and lowering an electrode to this target
			- performing all the same procedures except for passing the electrical current
			- any behavioural difference between the two groups must result from the lesion and not the other procedures
		- researchers use this method less often today than in the past
			- instead, they might inject a chemical that kills neurons, or disables them temporarily, without harming the passing axons
			- they can also inject a chemical that disables a particular type of synapse
			- another option is the gene-knockout approach:
				- directs a mutation to a gene that regulates one type of cell, transmitter, or receptor.
	- transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS):
		- the application of magnetic stimulation to a portion of the scalp
		- can stimulate neurons in the area below the magnet, if the stimulation is sufficiently brief and mild
		- with stronger stimulation it inactivates the neurons, producing a “virtual lesion” that outlasts the magnetic stimulation itself 
		- enables researchers to study behaviour with some brain area active, then inactive, and then active again
- effects of brain stimulation:
	- if brain damage impairs some behaviour, stimulation should increase it
	- the old-fashioned way:
		- insert an electrode into an animal’s brain and deliver brief, mild currents to stimulate one area or another
		- limited value:
			- a given area has many types of neurons with varying functions
			- the electrical current stimulates all of them, as well as passing axons
	- optogenetics:
		- using light to control a limited population of neurons
		- how it works:
			- one protein reacts to light by opening a Na channel:
				- exciting the neuron
			- another reacts by opening a Cl channel:
				- producing inhibition
			- developing viruses that insert one of these proteins into a certain type of neuron, or even to just one part of the neuron
			- developing very thin optical fibres that can shine just the right amount of light onto neurons in a narrowly targeted brain area
		- an investigator can control the excitation or inhibition of one type of neuron in a small brain area with millisecond accuracy
- recording brain activity:
	- on rare occasions, researchers insert an electrode into a human neuron to record its activity
	- electroencephalograph (EEG):
		- records electrical activity of the brain through electrodes attached to the scalp 
		- electrodes glued to the scalp measure the average activity at any moment for the population of cells under the electrode
		- the output is amplified and recorded
		- useful for:
			- distinguishing between wakefulness and various stages of sleep
			- help with the diagnosis of epilepsy
			- record brain activity in response to a stimulus
				- evoked potentials
				- evoked responses
	- magnetoencephalograph (MEG):
		- similar to EEG
		- measures the faint magnetic fields generated by brain activity
		- identifies the approximate location of activity to within a centimetre
		- temporal resolution:
			- showing changes from one millisecond to the next
		- can:
			- identify the times at which various brain areas respond
			- trace a wave of brain activity from its point of origin to the other areas that process it
	- Positron-emission tomography (PET):
		- provides a high-resolution image of activity in a living brain 
		- recording the emission of radioactivity from injected chemicals
		- the person receives an injection of glucose/other chemical containing radioactive atoms
		- when a radioactive atom decays, it releases a positron that immediately collides with a nearby electron, emitting two gamma rays in opposite directions
		- the person’s head is surrounded by a set of gamma ray detectors
		- when two detectors record gamma rays at the same time, they identify a spot halfway between those detectors as the point of origin of the gamma rays
		- a computer uses this information to determine how many gamma rays came from each spot in the brain and therefore how much of the radioactive chemical is located in each area
		- the areas with the most radioactivity are presumably the ones with the most active neurons.
		- use radioactive chemicals with a short half-life
		- drawbacks:
			- expensive
			- exposing the brain to radioactivity
			- usually replaced with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	- MRI:
		- record the energy released by water molecules after removal of a magnetic field
		- fMRI:
			- a modified version of MRI based on hemoglobin instead of water
			- detecting the amount of hemoglobin with oxygen
			- when a brain area becomes more active:
				- blood vessels dilate to allow more blood flow to the area
				- as the brain area uses oxygen, the percentage of hemoglobin with oxygen decreases
			- method produces spectacular pictures, but difficulties arise when we interpret the results
			- what we got from fMRI:
				- brain areas responsible for pain really do decrease their response after getting a placebo
				- most memory tasks activate a wide array of brain areas to varying degrees
				- “mind wandering” activates diffuse areas called the brain’s default system
					- same areas are also active when people recall past experiences or imagine future ones
- correlating brain anatomy with behaviour:
	- used to use phrenology:
		- skull's shape 
		- proved to be shit
	- computerised axial tomography (CT/CAT scan):
		- a physician injects a dye into the blood to increase contrast in the image
		- then places the person’s head into a CT scanner
		- X-rays are passed through the head and recorded by detectors on the opposite side
		- the CT scanner is rotated slowly until a measurement has been taken at each angle over 180 degrees
		- a computer constructs images of the brain based on the measurements
		- helps detect tumours & other structural abnormalities.
	- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):
		- MRI device applies a powerful magnetic field to align all the axes of rotation, and then tilts them with a brief radio frequency field
		- when the radio frequency field is turned off, the atomic nuclei release electromagnetic energy as they relax and return to their original axis
		- by measuring that energy, MRI devices form an image of the brain
		- shows anatomical details smaller than a millimetre in diameter
		- drawback -> person must lie motionless in a confining, noisy apparatus
		- usually not suitable for children & anyone who fears enclosed places
	- a particular brain area is enlarged in certain types of people:
		- people with a larger amygdala tend to have more social contacts
		- extroversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness correlate significantly with the size of certain areas of the cortex
		- certain aspects of executive function correlate with the amount of white matter connecting three parts of the prefrontal cortex to other brain areas 
		- adolescents with a large vocabulary tend to have more than average grey matter in part of the parietal lobe
		- we need to examine correlations like these with caution
			- many of the studies have used small, possibly unrepresentative samples
			- many reports relating brain anatomy to behaviour have been hard to replicate
- methods of studying brain-behaviour relationships - table:
	![[Pasted image 20240430120026.png]]
- summary:
	- one way to study brain-behaviour relationships is to examine the effects of brain damage
	- if someone suffers a loss after some kind of brain damage, then that area contributes in some way to that behaviour
	- if stimulation of a brain area increases some behaviour, presumably that area contributes to the behaviour
	- optogenetics is a relatively new method that enables researchers to stimulate a particular type of cell at a particular moment
	- researchers try to understand brain-behaviour relationships by recording activity in various brain areas during a given behaviour
	- people who differ with regard to some behaviour sometimes also differ with regard to their brain anatomy
	- MRI is one modern method of imaging a living brain
	- correlations between behaviour and anatomy should be evaluated cautiously until they have been replicated.
